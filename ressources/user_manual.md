## <center> Content of the library

Two classes are defined in this library:
* **SEPTENTRIO_GNSS** for general input and ouput limited to the receiver. 
* **SEPTENTRIO_NTRIP** for all operations related to NTRIP (see the NTRIP Client example's folder for more explanations). A caster and port must be provided when initializing. It can function with NTRIP 1 and 2, and HTTP protocol.
Both need a **two-way serial connection** to the receiver to be initialized and work correctly. 

A debug mode can be enabled for both by using the _enableDebug_ function and providing a port capable of displaying the messages (for instance the serial monitor).<br>

## <center> Examples </center>
This library's examples have been tested with a Mosaic-go and Arduino Uno, and Arduino R4 WiFi for the NTRIP features. <br>  
The examples use the Serial monitor but can be adapted to work without easily.  
Some example use the __AltSoftSerial__ library with its __default pins__ (9 for tx and 8 for rx) at a baudrate of __9600__. This is not mandatory to use the library and was only done for testing purposes. However, you always need a **two-way serial connection** between Arduino and receiver.

* read_PVTGeodetic : 
    * display the PVTGeodetic data (see SBF block) in the serial monitor.
    * This example can be easily adapted for all SBF blocks (see [this page](https://customersupport.septentrio.com/s/article/What-is-SBF-and-where-can-I-find-more-information-about-it) for reference)
* read_GGA :
    * Display GGA data in the serial monitor
* write_command:
    * Send commands to the receiver from the Serial monitor
    * Can be used to send or get configuration or check that the receiver works correctly
* log_PVTGeodetic : 
    * not yet tested
* ntrip_client : 
    * creates an NTRIP client from the Arduino board and sends correction data to the receiver through serial
    * This example requiers a WiFi connection to work

#### What this example does 
This example sets up a connection between the Arduino board and the Septentrion GNSS and allows for commands to be sen through the serial monitor
This example has been tested with "setSBFOutput, Stream1, USB2, PVTGeod, sec2" and "setSBFOutput, Stream1, none, none, off", the data from USB2 was monitored through DataLink.
If you have issue with this example, make sure your receiver can receive commands, the "SSSSSSSSSS" command should make sure of it if input is as default ('auto') as long as no correction is sent.

#### Resources
You can learn how to find a list of the commands for your receiver [here](https://customersupport.septentrio.com/s/article/CLI-supported-commands)

#### How to adapt it for you
You can simply have the commands be part of the code and not input. You can also easily reuse this feature in other code to configure your receiver.

#### What this example does ##

This examples sets up a connection between the Arduino board and the Septentrion GNSS, parses the incoming data and displays it in the serial monitor. It takes do-not-use values into account and displays them as "INVALID". Raw bit value are not translated to their meaning.

#### Learn more about SBF

PVTGeodetic is the proprietary septentrio PVT message in a geodetic system (as opposed to carthesian), it is part of Septentrio's SBF messages. <br>
SBF is the Septentrio proprietary binary message format, you can learn more about it on [this page](https://customersupport.septentrio.com/s/article/What-is-SBF-and-where-can-I-find-more-information-about-it).

#### The PVTGeodetic message

#### How to adapt it for you

You will first need to know the structure of the SBF message you want to parse from the link above. Once that is done, you will need to replace the ID of PVTGeodetic with yours in the *checkNewByte* parameters to get the full message.
Afterwards, you only need to use the conversion functions for the different data types (called [name_of_type]Conv) or extract the bits.

* [The NMEA message](#the-nmea-message)  
* [How to adapt it for you](#how-to-adapt-it-for-you-2)  

#### What this example does 

This examples sets up a connection between the Arduino board and the Septentrion GNSS, and displays it in the serial monitor. 
It test the ID and checksum and displays the raw message with empty fields left if they are correct
The message ID *msgId* can be fully explicit or use '*' for any character (for instance : 'G*GGA' to allow 'GP', 'GN'... ).

#### The NMEA message 

The structure of the GGA sentence is the following:  

| Field name  | Description |
| :---------: | :-----------| 
| 0           | Message ID: $GNGGA |
| 1           | UTC of position fix |
| 2           | Latitude in degrees minute |
| 3           | Direction of latitude : <br> N : North <br> S : South |
| 4           | Longitude in degrees minute |
| 5           | Direction of longitude : <br> E : East <br> W : West |
| 6           | GPS quality indicator : <ul> <li> 0: Fix not valid </li> <li> 1: GPS fix </li> <li> 2: Differential GPS fix (DGNSS), SBAS, OmniSTAR VBS, Beacon, RTX in GVBS mode </li> <li> 3: PPS fix </li> <li> 4: RTK fix </li> <li> 5: RTK Float, OmniSTAR XP/HP, Location RTK, RTX </li> <li> 6: INS Dead reckoning </li> <li> 7 : Manual input mode </li> <li> 8 : Simulation mode </li> </ul> |
| 7           | Number of sattelites in use |
| 8           | Horizontal Dilution Of Precision (HDOP) |
| 9           | Orthometric height |
| 10          | M for meter, unit of previous field |
| 11          | Geoid separation |
| 12          | M for meter, unit of previous field |
| 13          | Age of correction data for differential GPS fix or RTK, in seconds |
| 14          | Correction station ID number |
| 15          | Checksum delimiter '*' and checksum value as two hex characters|

#### How to adapt it for you
You only need to change the ID in *checkNewByte* to get a different type of NMEA message.  
Mind that the buffer alloted is only 82 bytes long, if you're using bigger messages you will need to change *nmeaMaxSize* in Septentrio_Arduino_driver.h.

#### Table of content
* [What this example does](#what-this-example-does-3)  
* [How to adapt it for you](#how-to-adapt-it-for-you-3)

#### What this example does
This example will log incoming data from the receiver with the PVTGeodetic ID to SD card on the Arduino board. It will first check  that the message is correct, ie. not do-not-use times and correctCRC, plus correct ID.
#### How to adapt it for you
This example could also be adapted to NMEA messages by changing the ID of *checkNewByte* (and set the optional parameter to true if needed).
As is, this example can't be used for multiple message ID as *checkNewByte* only accepts one ID.

* [How to adapt it for you](#how-to-adapt-it-for-you-4)  

#### What is NTRIP?
<img align=right src="https://github.com/septentrio-gnss/Septentrio_Arduino_library/blob/main/images/NTRIP_diagram.png" width=330 height=200/>
NTRIP, or Network Transport of RTCM via Internet Protocol, is a protocol for streaming RTK (Real Time Kinematic) corrections through an internet connection. <br>

It is based on HTTP/1.1 protocol and is composed of:
* A caster 
* A client : for data access
* A server : for upload from an input source

To connect to an NTRIP caster, you need:

|    Parameter    | Possible value | Default | Description |
|      :-:        |       :-:      |   :-:   |     :-:     |
|    User-Agent   | Any character string | USER_AGENT in *secrets.h*| A name for the user using the NTRIP (has no impact on the connection) |
| Host name | Any character string |  | The host name of the NTRIP service provider | 
| Caster port | A two-byte unsigned integer | 2101 | The port number of the NTRIP service provider |
| User | Any character string |  | The username used for authentication with the ntrip server |
| Password | Any character string |  | The password used for authentication with the ntrip server |
| Mountpoint | Any character string |  | The mountpoint of the ntrip server, if you don't know which are available for your ntrip server you can call for the sourcetable by leaving it empty|
| Custom | Any character string up to 100 characters |  | A custom field if a field needed by the ntrip server is not standard |
The maximum size of the NTRIP message is 500 character, leaving a maximum of 419 bytes for those parameters (excluding custom). Note that the user and password will change size when going through base64 encryption.
NMEA has its own maximum size of 100 bytes, independently of other parameters.

#### What this example does 

This example has been tested with an Arduino Uno R4 WiFi but should be usable with any Arduino hardware with minimal modification. <br> 
This example connects to a WPA2 network, you might need to modify the WiFi connection in the example if another type is used. It will then connect to an NTRIP caster using the data provided by the user in *secrets.h*. Correction from the NTRIP will then be passed directly to the receiver once the connexion is established and messages are received. <br>
This example has a secrets.h file containing the different data needed for the connection (at the very minimum, the WiFi IP and password) which can be freely modified by the user. A default NMEA string is also set in the .ino file to setup the connection without having to wait for the receiver, you can either disable it or add lines to get it from the receiver with the *exeNMEAOnce, YourPort, GGA* command. <br>
*Note:* If you are unsure if you need GGA, I would suggest setting it up even with approximate data. <br>
<br>
This program can also be run with a debug mode to use with a monitor (ex. the Serial Monitor).

#### Hardware setup

This example requires : 
* an Arduino board or module with an internet connection and functionning uart port
* a Septentrio receiver, make sure its baudrate and the one used in the code match
* a uart connection between the Arduino and Septentrio receiver

#### How to adapt it for you
You can adapt to any WiFi that could be supported by your Arduino board. The same way, you can adapt to any NTRIP caster that used no or basic authentication.  
If you only want to get the sourcetable, you can leave the mountpoint empty and display the incoming data.
