# Example : Reading PVTGeodetic #

## What this example does ##

This examples sets up a connection between the Arduino board and the Septentrion GNSS, parses the incoming data and displays it in the serial monitor. It takes do-not-use values into account and displays them as INVALID. Raw bit value are not translated to their meaning.

## The PVTGeodetic block ##
